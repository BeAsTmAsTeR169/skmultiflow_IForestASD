# skmultiflow_IForestASD
 IForestASD for Anomaly Detection in Scikit-MultiFLow.

This code is related to the publication IForestASD for Anomaly Detection in Scikit-MultiFLow.
Code source and notebooks provided have been used to compute results mentionned in the experimental evaluation.

## Algorithm implemented (IForestASD, Ding & Fei, 2013)
This code provide an open source implementation of Isolation Forest ASD algoritm by Ding & Fei 
This implementation is built on top of scikit-multiflow, an open source machine learning framework for data streams https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/. It provide a variety of streaming methods : Incremental & Adaptive learning, from both supervised, unsupervised algorithms to multi-outpout and data stream generators.
